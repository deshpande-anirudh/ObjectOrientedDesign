### **Requirements**
1. **Game Board**:
   - A 3x3 grid is displayed using text-based output.
   - Each cell can hold `"X"`, `"O"`, or remain empty (`" "`).

2. **Two Players**:
   - Player `"X"` and Player `"O"` alternate turns.
   - `"O"` is controlled by the computer with random move generation.

3. **Move Validation**:
   - Only valid moves (within bounds and on unoccupied cells) are allowed.
   - Prompts users to re-enter moves if invalid.

4. **Winning Conditions**:
   - Checks rows, columns, and diagonals to determine if a player has won.

5. **Tie Condition**:
   - Declares a tie if the board is completely filled and no player has won.

6. **Game Over**:
   - Ends the game immediately upon a win or tie, displaying the result.

7. **Computer Opponent**:
   - The computer makes random moves until it finds an empty cell.

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **Replay Option**:
   - Allow the user to restart the game after it ends, without restarting the program.

2. **Smarter AI**:
   - Replace the random move logic with a basic strategy (e.g., block the opponent's winning move or make winning moves).
   - Optionally, implement advanced AI using algorithms like Minimax for harder difficulty.

3. **Move Undo**:
   - Add the ability to undo the last move.

4. **Input Improvements**:
   - Allow players to enter moves as `row,column` instead of a single string (e.g., `1,2` instead of `12`).

5. **Custom Player Names**:
   - Let users input custom names for `"X"` and `"O"`.

6. **Scoring System**:
   - Track the number of wins, losses, and ties for multiple rounds.

7. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Create a visual version of the game using libraries like `tkinter` or `pygame`.

8. **Multiplayer Mode**:
   - Enable two players to play locally or add an online multiplayer feature.

9. **Customizable Grid**:
   - Allow users to choose a custom board size (e.g., 4x4 or 5x5 grids).

10. **Enhanced Feedback**:
    - Highlight the winning row, column, or diagonal when a player wins.

11. **Timer for Moves**:
    - Add a timer for each playerâ€™s turn to make the game more challenging.
